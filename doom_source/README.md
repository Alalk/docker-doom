* Taken from - http://www.doomworld.com/pageofdoom/shareware.html
* Actually hosted on - ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/doom/doom19s.zip

## Be wary of .exe files from strangers!

* I had to include these binaries for the build process
* `doom19s_deiced.zip` contains files with known checksums (`DOOM.EXE`, etc..) but the file itself wouldn't be a known checksum.
* There's probably no reason for you to open these files anyway!
